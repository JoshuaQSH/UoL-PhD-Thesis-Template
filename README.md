# University of Leeds - PhD thesis template

## Distributed Systems and Services (DSS) | School of Computing sharing

This repository contains a $LaTeX$ template for creating PhD thesis at the University of Leeds. The original template is copied from: https://github.com/stonerlab/Thesis-template/tree/PhD

Notes: currently the title should be within 4 lines (included), otherwise the title page will go bizarre.

- `Macros`: General thesis style settings
- `Codes`: For Code snippets
- `Sources`: For figures sources (e.g. vsdx files)
- `ThesisFigs`: Figures for logos 
- `GuidesAndOthers`: University thesis guides

- Fill in the .tex files in the various sub-directories with your content.

Good luck with the thesis writing :)
